LIF Extractor is a command line utility for extracting the LIF files
found in LEGO Digital Designer. It will extract all files contained
inside the LIF archives, into folders adjacent to the archive it was
called on. The LIFExtractor.py file requires a python installation
to run. The executables found in the folders have no dependencies.
Choose the proper folder for your operating system. The Python
script has been tested to work on Python versions 2.7 through 3.2.

To extract LIF files, pass the path to the LIF files as command line 
arguments to the program. On Windows, this can be done by dragging
and dropping the LIF files onto the LIFExtractor.exe icon in the
explorer window.

This program was created to allow for interoperability with the LEGO
Digital Designer formats. In order to properly read the LEGO Digital
Designer formats, it is necessary to access the data contained with
the LIF file archives.
